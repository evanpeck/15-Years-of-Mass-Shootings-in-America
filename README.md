# 15 Years of Mass Shootings in America

A visual and audio experience of data from [Stanford's Mass Shootings in America dataset](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/mass-shootings-america). Created using [p5js](http://p5js.org/). A working presentation can be viewed at <http://eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/mass_shootings/>.

While time series data is traditionally best understood by using a simple line graph, my goal in this sketch was to create a more visceral experience. Each mass shooting is represented by the sound of a single gunshot. The background color intensifies to reflect the number of people killed, before slowly fading to black. See and hear how we have changed over the last 15 years.
